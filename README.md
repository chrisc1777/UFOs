# UFOs

## Overview
Dana is requesting to build a website for her article regarding ufo sightings using HTML and improve aesthetics with CSS. Javascript is also needed to provide a dynamic table displaying a list of sighting descriptions. Since Dana has a long list of data, she would like to have search filters for attributes such as date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
The landing page of Dana's article along with a dynamic table of ufo sightings data

The filter section has placeholder text in each search box to help users with their inputs. Users must type an entire keyword all in lowercase and then click "Filter Table" button to search for matching data.

## Summary
Adding a function for filters and filtered table results in Javascript certainly makes the website easier to navigate for users.

Con:
- One major drawback is that the search box  is limited to lowercase inputs only, you will not get any results otherwise

Recommendations:
- Adding a drop-down menu to filters as an alternative to the text search box so that users have more options to find a specific sighting.
- Adding more filtering controls like ascending and descending to the attributes columns so that users can organize the data to their preference.
